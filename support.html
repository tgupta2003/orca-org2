            Here's how...</p> 
            <p class="hab2">1. Get educated by checking out conservation organizations such as Born Free</a>, and the Whale and Dolphin Conservation <br><br>


            2. Stand against performances or attractions that keep orcas in captivity for entertainment â€” reach out to your local attraction park and voice your stance. <br> <br> 

            3. Support scientific research which helps us better understand these creatures and how to protect them. A couple good places to start include: NOAA Fisheries - Northwest Fisheries Science Center, Orca Behavior Institute, and the Center for Whale Research (CWR): <br> <br> 

            4. Be responsible and empathetic when interacting with any form of wildlife -- especially when you find yourself in their habitats.
