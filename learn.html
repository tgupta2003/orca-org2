            <p class="hab">HABITATS & ECOSTYSTEM</p> 
            <p class="hab2">Orcas prefer higher latitudes and costal areas and can be spotted in the coasts of Iceland, Norway, Argentina, New Zealand, California, Alaska, and more. Although they are prevalent in arctic waters, they can also be found in tropical waters. In their ecosystem, orcas are top predators and prey on other predators such as sharks, seals, other dolphins, and whales. Their social groups “family pods” that they form are significant to the way they hunt and behave in the water (their culture). In recent years, the abundance of boats and underwater noise have had an impact on the way orcas feed and interact through echolocation. Their reproductive organs and tissues are also prone to toxic contamination from industrial chemicals from mad-made interaction.

            <p class="mis2">Orcas prefer higher latitudes and costal areas and can be spotted - Contrary to western belief, orcas’ interactions with humans in the wild have resulted 0 fatal deaths reported to this day. Historically, these sea mammals have been described as “killers” by sailors due to their group hunting sessions preying on whales. As a result, the term “killer whale” took hold. The media often portrays the mammals as aggressive and dangerous instead of educating the public on their fascinating social behaviors and curiosity.

            <p class="cap">CAPTIVITY & SEAWORLD</p> 
            <p class="cap2">In captivity, it is estimated that orcas live to an average lifespan of 20 years. Additionally, in the wild, orcas can travel to uptown 160 kilometers in a day, making even a relatively large “pool” where an orca is kept captive far too small for them to develop naturally. A notable side effect of captivity lies in the fin — known as dorsal fin collapse. In captivity, 60-90% of males will see their fin collapse. Captivity leaves these animals helpless without control over their habits and aggression. The only 4 recorded fatalities by orcas on humans have all been in captivity — 3 of these deaths being from Tilikum: the largest orca kept captive in Seaward, Orlando. The documentary Blackfish illustrates the build up of lives taken by Tilikum and how, instead of seeing him as a 12,500 pound killer, we see him as a product of an organization that bred these killers by stripping them of their natural environment.
